However, before you start looking for a torrent download link, you should be aware of the risks and consequences of pirating software.

On Lyonsden Blog, a reviewer posted a detailed account of their experience with the collection, especially the animated linking book. They wrote: "Itâs turned out to be a lovely collectors item, just liked Iâd hoped for. It really does look like a well worn antique book with the way theyâve finished it with faux cracks and worn out fabric and gilding. The linking part is something that only a video can do justice to though so here it is!"
