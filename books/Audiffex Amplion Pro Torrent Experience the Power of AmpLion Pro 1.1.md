## Step 4: Connect your Icom transceiver to your PC
 
Depending on your Icom transceiver model, you may need a USB cable or an Ethernet cable to connect it to your PC. Some transceivers, such as the IC-7610, IC-9700, IC-7851 and IC-7700 have a built-in network function, so you only need an Ethernet cable. Other transceivers, such as the IC-7300 and IC-7100 need a USB cable to send and receive audio signals and CI-V commands. The IC-705 can be connected to a PC over a local Wi-Fi network.
 
You may also need to install a USB driver or update the firmware of your transceiver before using it with the RS-BA1 software. You can find more information on the Icom website[^2^] or in your transceiver's manual.
 
## Step 5: Launch the RS-BA1 software and enjoy remote operation
 
After connecting your Icom transceiver to your PC, you can launch the RS-BA1 software from your desktop or start menu. You may need to configure some settings, such as the IP address, port number, audio device and CI-V address of your transceiver. You can use the Setup Wizard in the remote utility software to help you with this process.
 
Once everything is set up, you can enjoy remote operation of your ham radio with the RS-BA1 software. You can switch between different modes, adjust various parameters, record voice messages, use CW keyer functions and view spectrum scope and waterfall displays. You can also use an optional RC-28 remote control USB encoder to simulate a tuning knob and two function keys.
