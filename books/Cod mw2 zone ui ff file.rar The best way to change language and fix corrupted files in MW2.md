## Solution 1: Verify the integrity of game files
 
One of the most common reasons for this error is that some of the game files are corrupted or missing. To fix this, you can use the Steam client to verify the integrity of game files. This will scan and repair any damaged or missing files in your game folder. Here are the steps to do this:
 
1. Open Steam and go to your **Library**.
2. Right-click on **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2** and select **Properties**.
3. Go to the **Local Files** tab and click on **Verify Integrity of Game Files**.
4. Wait for the process to complete and then restart your computer.
5. Launch the game and see if the error is gone.

## Solution 2: Update your graphics card driver
 
Another possible cause for this error is that your graphics card driver is outdated or incompatible with the game. To fix this, you can update your graphics card driver to the latest version. You can do this manually by visiting the manufacturer's website and downloading the appropriate driver for your system. Alternatively, you can use a driver updater tool that can automatically scan and update your drivers for you. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Download and install a driver updater tool of your choice.
2. Run the tool and scan your computer for any outdated or missing drivers.
3. Select your graphics card driver and click on **Update**.
4. Wait for the update to finish and then restart your computer.
5. Launch the game and see if the error is gone.

To fix this, you can change your game language settings to match your system language settings. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open Steam and go to your **Library**.
2. Right-click on **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2** and select **Properties**.
